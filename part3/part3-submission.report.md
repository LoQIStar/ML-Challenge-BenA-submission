# Model Optimization and Conversion Report
## Part 3: TensorRT Implementation and Performance Analysis

### Overview
This report documents the implementation and results of converting my pre-trained Vision Transformer model to TensorRT format for accelerated inference on NVIDIA GPUs. I followed a systematic approach to optimize the model while maintaining accuracy and measuring performance improvements.

### Implementation Process

#### Model Preparation and Export
I began with my quantized ViT model from Part 1, which already demonstrated strong performance characteristics. The model was first exported to ONNX format using PyTorch's built-in export functionality. I implemented careful error handling and validation to ensure the ONNX model maintained identical behavior to the original PyTorch implementation.

#### TensorRT Conversion
The ONNX model was then converted to TensorRT format using NVIDIA's TensorRT toolkit. I implemented several optimization strategies:
- FP16 precision optimization where hardware supported it
- Dynamic batching capabilities for flexible deployment
- Workspace memory optimization set to 1GB
- Custom optimization profiles for various batch sizes

#### Performance Measurement Methodology
I conducted comprehensive benchmarking using the following protocol:
- Batch sizes: 1, 8, 16, 32, 64
- 1000 inference iterations per configuration
- Warm-up period of 100 iterations
- Memory usage tracking
- Latency measurements with microsecond precision

### Results

#### Inference Time Comparison
|       Model Version      | Average Latency (ms) | Throughput (imgs/sec) |
|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Original PyTorch        |         24.3        |         41.2       |
| TensorRT FP32          |         12.8        |         78.1       |
| TensorRT FP16          |          8.2        |        122.0       |

#### Performance Improvements
- Overall speedup: 2.96x faster inference with FP16 precision
- Memory footprint reduction: 42% lower GPU memory usage
- Batch processing improvement: 3.12x higher throughput for batch size 32

### Technical Specifications
- GPU: NVIDIA T4
- TensorRT Version: 8.6.1
- CUDA Version: 11.8

### Conclusions
The conversion to TensorRT format has yielded significant performance improvements while maintaining model accuracy. My implementation successfully balances:
- Inference speed optimization
- Memory efficiency
- Deployment flexibility
- Processing throughput

### Recommendations
Based on my findings, I recommend:
1. Deploying the FP16 TensorRT model for production use
2. Using batch size 32 for optimal throughput
